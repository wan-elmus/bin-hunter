For the b- operator;
This code snippet is a function of a bash script that validates the "-b" option passed to the script as an argument.

The code first splits the argument passed with the "-b" option into two parts: an operator and a value in bytes. The operator is the first part of the argument before the comma, and the value in bytes is the second part after the comma.

If either of these two parts is not present, the script will print an error message "Invalid argument for -b option. Exiting..." and exits with a return code of 1.

Then, the code uses a case statement to check the value of the operator, and maps it to a corresponding operator in Bash syntax. For example, "GT" is mapped to ">", "LT" is mapped to "<", "LE" is mapped to "<=", and so on. If the operator is not one of the expected values, the script will print an error message "Invalid operator for -b option. Exiting..." and exits with a return code of 1.

Finally, the script will check if the passed argument is other than "-b" and if true it will print an error message "Invalid option. Exiting..." and exits with a return code of 1.

The purpose of this code snippet is to ensure that the option passed to the script is valid and in the correct format before continuing with the execution of the script.

The code uses a case statement to check the value of the operator passed as an argument after the "-b" option.
A case statement is a way to control the flow of a shell script by testing the value of a variable or expression against a list of patterns.
In this specific case, the script is checking the value of the operator passed as an argument and mapping it to a corresponding operator in Bash syntax.

For example:

if the operator passed is "GT", the script maps it to ">"
if the operator passed is "LT", the script maps it to "<"
if the operator passed is "LE", the script maps it to "<="
if the operator passed is "GE", the script maps it to ">="
if the operator passed is "EQ", the script maps it to "=="
if the operator passed is "NE", the script maps it to "!="
If the operator passed is not one of the expected values, the script will print an error message "Invalid operator for -b option. Exiting..." and exits with a return code of 1.

The exit code is a way for the script to communicate to the system the success or failure of the script's execution. The value of 0 typically indicates success and a non-zero value indicates failure. In this case, the script is exiting with a value of 1, indicating that the operator passed as an argument was not valid.

By using the case statement, the script is able to handle different variations of the operator passed as an argument and ensure that the operator passed is in the correct format before continuing with the execution of the script.
